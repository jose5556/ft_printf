# Ft_printf

This is the ft_printf project, completed during my studies at School 42. The goal of this project is to create a custom implementation of the printf function in C, allowing for formatted output to the console.


## Overview

In this project, I have implemented a function that mimics the behavior of the standard printf function in C. This includes formatting specifiers such as %s for strings, %d for integers, %x / %X for exadecimal numbers, and various others.

For more detailed information about the implementation, please take a look to the subject file located alongside the other project files.

Feel free to explore the ft_printf.h header file for documentation on all implemented functions and format specifiers.
